## Exploratory Data Analysis

Here, I'm loading the dataset from Dunham *et al*. (2020).
```{r}
f <- "data/Dunham et al. (2020) dataset.xlsx"
d <- read_excel(f,sheet = 1, col_names = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
(head(d)) #For a view of the first few lines of the data set
```

Various kinematic and substrate variables and were calculated by Dunham *et al*. (2020) from the data available in their published dataset (pp. 3-4). 

The variable relative branch diameter (**relBrnchDiamNsTl**) is a ratio of the branch diameter relative to primate body length measure from nose to base of tail (Dunham *et al*., 2020a). Dunham *et al*. (2020a) used these relative branch diameter ratios to group substrate into three size categories: small ("less than half of an individual’s trunk diameter"), medium ("between half and equal to an individual’s trunk diameter"), and large ("greater than an individual’s trunk diameter") (p. 4). Here, I am adding a new variable to my dataset, **relBrnchDiamCategories**, to categorize substrate for each observation as described above.

```{r}
d <- d |> mutate(relBrnchDiamCategories = case_when( #Creating new variable categorizing relative substrate diameter
  relBrnchDiamNsTl >= 0.5 & relBrnchDiamNsTl <= 1 ~ "Medium",
  relBrnchDiamNsTl > 1 ~ "Large",
  relBrnchDiamNsTl < 0.5 ~ "Small",
  TRUE ~ NA
  ))
d$relBrnchDiamCategories <- as.factor(d$relBrnchDiamCategories) #As factor because this is a categorical variable with levels.
(levels(d$relBrnchDiamCategories))
```

The variables sine of substrate orientation angle (**Sin_SbstOrient**) and cosine of substrate orientation angle (**Cos_SbstOrient**) are transformations of the raw substrate orientation angle measurement in degrees (Dunham et al., 2020a, p. 4). Dunham *et al*. (2020a) used these to group substrate into three orientation categories: horizontal ("between -30 and 30 deg"), decline ("less than -30 deg"), and incline ("greater than 30 deg") (p. 4). Here, I am adding a new variable to my dataset, **SbstOrientCategories**, to categorize substrate for each observation as described above. The choice to use **Sin_SbstOrient** to calculate orientation angle is because, unlike **Cos_SbstOrient**, it can differentiate declines and inclines (Dunham *et al*., 2020a).

```{r}
d$Sin_SbstOrient_Numeric <- as.numeric(d$Sin_SbstOrient) #Changing Sin_SbstOrient to numeric
d$Angle_SbstOrient <- (asin(d$Sin_SbstOrient_Numeric))*(180/pi) #Converting sin to angle (deg)

d <- d |> mutate(SbstOrientCategories = case_when( #Creating new variable categorizing substrate orientation
  Angle_SbstOrient >= -30 & Angle_SbstOrient <= 30 ~ "Horizontal",
  Angle_SbstOrient < -30 ~ "Decline",
  Angle_SbstOrient > 30 ~ "Incline",
  TRUE ~ NA
  ))

d$SbstOrientCategories <- as.factor(d$SbstOrientCategories) #As factor because this is a categorical variable with levels.
(levels(d$SbstOrientCategories))
```

Because only Genus in included as a column in the published dataset, I decided to add columns both for species (**Species**) and binomial nomenclature (**Binomial**).

```{r}
d <- d |> mutate(Species = case_when( #Creating new variable, Species
  Genus == "Cebuella" ~ "pygmaea",
  Genus == "Saguinus" ~ "tripartitus"
  ))
d <- d |> mutate(Binomial = paste(Genus, Species, sep = " ")) #Creating new variable, Binomial, by concatenating **Genus** and **Species** using paste()
```

Dunham *et al*. (2020a) define the variables relative forelimb lead duration (**relFLldMS**) and relative hindlimb lead duration (**relHLldMS**) represent "the interval between touchdowns within a limb girdle divided by the total contact duration of the limb girdle" (p. 4). Dunham *et al*. (2020a) used these to differentiate symmetrical gaits ("temporal lag between the left and right limbs in each girdle amounted to 50±10% of stride duration") from asymmetrical gaits (values outside the symmetrical gait range) (p. 3). Within asymmetrical gaits, these variables were additionally used to differentiate bounds (both forelimb and hindlimb stance periods were nearly simultaneous), half-bounds (hindlimb stance periods were nearly simultaneous
but forelimb stance periods were staggered), and gallops (both forelimb and hindlimb stance periods were staggered) (p. 3).

Here, I am first adding two new columns to my dataset, **FL** and **HL**, to store whether forelimb touchdowns and hindlimb touchdowns, respectively, were simultaneous ("the interval between the trailing and leading limb mid-support was ≤10% of total limb pair contact duration") or staggered ("the interval between the trailing and leading limb mid-support was
≥10% of total limb pair contact duration") for each observation (Dunham *et al.*, 2020a, p. 3). Following from this, I am adding a new variable, **GaitType2**, which categorizes each observation as a symmetrical gait, a bound, a half-bound, or a gallop (p. 3).

```{r}
d <- d |> #Categorizing forelimb stance periods as nearly simultaneous or staggered based on relative forelimb lead duration, relFLldMS
  mutate(FL = case_when(
    relFLldMS <= 0.1 ~ "simultaneous",
    relFLldMS > 0.1 ~ "staggered"
  ))
d <- d |> #Categorizing hindlimb stance periods as nearly simultaneous or staggered based on relative hindlimb lead duration, relHLldMS
  mutate(HL = case_when(
    relHLldMS <= 0.1 ~ "simultaneous",
    relHLldMS > 0.1 ~ "staggered"
  ))

d <- d |> mutate(GaitType2 = case_when( #Categorizing gait types based on both forelimb and hindlimb stance periods
  `Gait Type` == "Sym" ~ "Symmetrical",
  FL == "simultaneous" & HL == "simultaneous" ~ "Bound",
  FL == "staggered" & HL == "simultaneous" ~ "Half-bound",
  FL == "staggered" & HL == "staggered" ~ "Gallop"
))
```

## Descriptive Statistics

Here, I attempting to replicate **Table 1**, which summarizes the number of strides (n=209) for different substrate diameter (small, medium, large) and orientation categories (decline, horizontal, incline) in free-ranging *Saguinus tripartitus* (n=108) and *Cebuella pygmaea* (n=101) (p. 4). Dunham *et al*. (2020a) clarify that each observation in the dataset represents one stride (n = 209) (p. 3).

```{r}
tab1a <- (table(d$Binomial,d$relBrnchDiamCategories)) #Creating a table summarizing the frequency of each substrate diameter category across observations of Saguinus and Cebuella strides
```

```{r}
tab1b <- (table(d$Binomial,d$SbstOrientCategories)) #Creating a table summarizing the frequency of each substrate orientation category across observations of Saguinus and Cebuella strides
```

```{r}
tab1 <- cbind(tab1a,tab1b) #Combining the above two tables to more accurately replicate Table 1
tab1 <- kable(tab1, caption = "Table 1. Number of strides for different substrate diameter and orientation categories in free-ranging <i>Saguinus tripartitus</i> and <i>Cebuella pygmaea</i>")|> #Adding a title
        add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Substrate diameter" = 3, "Substrate orientation" = 3))|> #Adding subtitles over the specified groups of columns
        kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) |> #Fixing the spacing of the columns, which were crowded together without this specification
        row_spec(0, extra_css = "margin-bottom: 10px;") #Fixing the spacing of the rows, which were crowded together without this specification
(tab1)
```
Here is Table 1 for comparison (Dunham *et al*., 2020, p.4):

```{r echo = FALSE, width = "###px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Table1.jpg") #Embedding .jpg from folder in repo
```

My values for the number of strides observed for each substrate orientation category match exactly. However, looking instead at substrate diameter, while the stride numbers sum to the correct number of observations for *Saguinus tripartitus* (n=108) and *Cebuella pygmaea* (n=101), my distribution of strides across substrate diameter categories does not match Table 1 (Dunham *et al.*, 2020a). Dunham et al. (2020a) state that the variable relative branch diameter (**relBrnchDiamNsTl**) is a ratio of the branch diameter relative to primate body length measure from nose to base of tail (p. 4). Because a small substrate was defined as one "less than half of an individual’s trunk diameter," I assigned this category to observations where **relBrnchDiamNst** < 0.5 (Dunham *et al*., 2020a, p. 4). Because a medium substrate was defined as one "between half and equal to an individual’s trunk diameter," I assigned this category to observations where 0.5 >= **relBrnchDiamNst** <= 1 (Dunham *et al*., 2020a, p. 4). Lastly, because a large substrate was defined as one "between half and equal to an individual’s trunk diameter," I assigned this category to observations where **relBrnchDiamNst** > 1 (Dunham *et al*., 2020a, p. 4). Therefore, while I believe my assignment of these categories matches their presented definitions, there appears to be some discrepancy between how I assigned these categories and how they were assigned by Dunham *et al*. (2020a). One potential explanation is that **relBrnchDiamNst** in the published dataset is likely a Box–Cox transformed value, as other variables in the published dataset clearly are already transformed according to the methods outlined by Dunham *et al*.'s (2020a) in the "Statistical analyses" section (p. 4). I unfortunately cannot revert these values back to their raw values to test if this is the issue because the lambda value used as the transformation parameter is not specified. 

## Inferential Statistical Analysis

### Linear Mixed Models

```{r}

```

We used linear mixed models to examine the effects of substrate
diameter and substrate orientation on continuous kinematic
variables, including relative speed, mean DF, mean NSL, relative
FLLD, relative HLLD and percent aerial phase. Relative speed was
entered as a covariate in statistical models for mean DF, mean NSL,
relative FLLD, relative HLLD and percent aerial phase in order to
control for speed-related effects on these kinematic variables.

[Be sure to **thoroughly** explain what replications you are doing and comment your code so that it is easy for a reader to understand. Include in this section relevant tables/figures/values from the original paper for comparison to what you accomplished with your replication. Note that I want you to do the bulk of any *exposition* using text and markdown syntax outside of code blocks. That is, your document should not just be one big code block with ***R*** style comments but rather a nicely formatted report with code separated from exposition, interpretation, and dicussion.]
